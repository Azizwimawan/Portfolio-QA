# 👋 About Me

🚀 **Product Owner | Business Analyst | QA Strategist**

I specialize in driving digital product rollouts across Europe, where complexity meets execution. With 5+ enterprise-grade POS systems launched in Italy, Hungary, and Lithuania, I combine business acumen with QA discipline and agile execution.

Previously led a product launch generating IDR 150M revenue in smart surveillance (AWAS360) and helped architect credit scoring and fraud detection systems at DBS Bank. I’m QA-certified, BA-certified, and bring a business-first mindset to every team I join.

Currently leading multi-country POS rollouts while running my own auto-trading business. My approach blends **systems thinking**, **root-cause analysis**, and **customer-driven development**. Let’s build something worth shipping.
