## 👋 About Me

Product Owner, Business Analyst, and QA Strategist with a cross-functional background delivering enterprise-grade POS systems and banking software across Europe and Southeast Asia. I specialize in aligning business goals with technical execution, leading rollouts in Italy, Hungary, and Lithuania, and building systemized testing pipelines across mobile, web, and API layers. I believe QA isn’t just about finding bugs—it's about **protecting product credibility** and building scalable systems.

I’m currently embedded in multi-country EU POS rollouts while running my own automotive business. My approach blends **system thinking**, **root-cause analysis**, and **agile discipline**. My mission: to launch quality-driven, user-centric software that scales.
